# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor or online tool. The icons will be displayed in the Chrome toolbar and extension management page.

For now, you can use placeholder icons or create simple colored squares with the extension name.
